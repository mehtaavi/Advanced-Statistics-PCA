Case Study - Performing PCA on Loan Transactions

Lending is one of the critical functions of any financial institution. Customers are provided loans across different products at competitive interest rates for an acceptable tenure. There is always a risk that a customer may •default on the loan or •may try and repay the loan in advance which leads to financial losses to the business. There may not be enough data or evidence available from the past which will help the firm to predict and mitigate the above possible risk. However, it does have information about the customer demographics, loan details, EMI transactions etc. which may contribute to 30+ features related to a customer’s loan account. Let’s apply PCA on this high dimension data, identify patterns and help the bank with some useful information to monitor the risk
